## Summary
We compared people with and without OCD on a fear conditioning fMRI task. We found very limited differences between the two across a set of analyses. Using multivariate PLS we found some interesting relationships with symptoms (though it was not a particularly reliable effect) and subjective task ratings. See the manuscript links above if you are interested.

## Questions?
This code is not very sophisticated and just calls other more elegant tools to do the analyses (e.g., fmriprep, spm, nilearn, afni, etc.,). Please contact me if you have questions.

## Organisation
- Notebooks: contains summaries of the analyses with code to generate figures.
- Code: contains the code base for all analyses split into behavioural, connectivity, glm, and preprocessing folders.
